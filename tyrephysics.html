        <h1>Physical explanation</h1>
        <h3>How wider is faster</h3>
        <p>Let's say that there is two tyres that are pumped to same pressure and both of them are subjected to equal amount of force. One of them is noticably wider than the other. The difference in width causes the shared area of tyre and ground to be different shaped. Still the area itself is equal as F=pA but the amount that tyre needs to stretch from natural form is different.</p>

        <p>The stretching which is also known as hysterisis is a continious cycle of stress and relief. Due to the nature of a pneumatic tyre in such process there is energy loss to heat.</p>
        <p>Riding can also cause permanent changes to terrain or the tyre. That makes riding on sand much more harder than on asphalt. Surface can also slow down rider by causing vibrations. Such phenomenon can be seen on surface like gravel. </p>
        <p>Wider tyres can sustain lower pressure without risk of ground hitting rim. Lower pressure and higher width increases the area between tyre and ground. So such tyre can absorb vibrations better and be more efficient in hard terrain. </p>
        <h3>How narrower is faster</h3>
        <p>Depending on the bike frame and the wheelset, the optimal tyre can be anything between 23-50mm. Still most often the best possible width for a road bike is 25 or 28 mm. When tyres get wider there is most often an aerodynamic penalty. This is due to the area increasing in CdA. </p>
        <p>Narrow tyre such as 23 mm can be pumped to very high pressure and on a perfectly even surface that is the most optimal tyre. That makes the narrow tyres popular on track racing.</p>
